# Advanced-Hangman-in-Python
Advanced Hangman CLI allows the player to pick word sources from 3 categories: capital cities, footballers or famous people.

The player also has a range of game difficulties to play the respective categories in.

Legacy mode is also available for players who wish to play using the original Hangman syntax.


All words are sourced from the included words.json file I created.
